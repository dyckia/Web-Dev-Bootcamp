# mongoose vs mongoDB

javascript layer on top of mongodb

ODM object document mapper

Using Mongoose, a user can define the schema for the documents in a particular collection. It provides a lot of convenience in the creation and management of data in MongoDB. 

Mongoose defines a schema for your data models so your documents follow a specific structure with pre-defined data types.

Mongoose has built in validation for schema definitions.

This saves you from writing a bunch of validation code that you have to otherwise write with the MongoDB driver. 

The downside here is that you will have to write larger amounts of code for validating the data, and the risk of errors is higher.

defeats the purpose of a NoSQL database.

slow performance.
